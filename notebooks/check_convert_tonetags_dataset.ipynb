The cramps get so bad sometimes that Ive woken up from them. Im sick of worrying about the possibility of pregnancy if the protection broke (I dont take/have birth control due to the risk of them negatively affecting me because I take antidepressants). My boyfriend and I have talked extensively about our thoughts about kids, and I stated that I dont ever want to give birth to a child. The reason why I dont want to give birth to a kid is that I dont want them to be burdened with my mental health genes. Now the reason why Im not getting bottom surgery is because I personally dont want to have bottom surgery. Ive learned to accept some parts of my body through therapy and with some bedroom therapy with my boyfriend iykyk. Another reason why I dont want it is because to be honest Im to damn impatient to properly clean out my rear door and prep myself anytime I want my boyfriend to rail me . And yes Ive done my research on bottom surgery, all the success and mishaps that can come with the procedure (also I dont want to take testosterone because of the body hair growth that will happen, Ive tried having long armpit and leg hair but I found that I cant stand the feeling of it on my own body) just because I dont want to take testosterone doesnt make me any less transmasc. Anyways rant over about that, Id like to hear some feedback on the topic of starting a go fund me since Ive never actually done something like this before and Im nervous if that would be the wrong thing to use it for.\n",

My friend at the time had gotten off at his stop that day and it was just me in the seat and the kid across the aisle starts talking to me and I dont remember how this happened but he brings up the fact that I used to cut. I told him to stop talking about it and that I didnt want to talk about it but he kept going and then this bitch starts saying hell save me with god and gospel type shit, I keep telling him to stop that I didnt believe in this and didnt want to hear it but he didnt listen and played it anyway the entire rest of the ride until we got off the bus. I avoided him like the plague after that and had music on my iPad to play through my headphones for the rest of middle school until Covid hit just in case he tried it again. Genuine question, is this fucked up or what? I still get uncomfortable thinking about it but it feels so small compared to what so many other people have gone through but its one of the main reasons I find it hard to trust religious people now and I feel like Im being overdramatic now.\n",
